                <br><br>
                A few years ago, I lived in Seoul as an ordinary schoolgirl, following the repetitive routine of studying, attending academies, and living within the confines of home, much like any other student in South Korea. For a while, I raced forward like a racehorse without reason, believing that was all I knew and considering it natural. However, my life changed after completing fifth grade in elementary school in Korea and seizing a great opportunity to study abroad in the United States.
                <br><br>
                From that moment in my life, the weight my backpack no longer felt burdensome. Here, with a different education system from South Korea, I gradually gained the freedom to explore my surroundings. My perspective on school and friendships shifted. I realized that living solely for upcoming exams, feeling pessimistic about grades, and considering it as the entirety of life led to losing positivity and hindered personal growth and drive.
                <br><br>
                Occasionally, I still face moments when things don't go as planned or when repetition makes me want to give up. However, at those moments, reading the phrase "Love the life you live, Live the life you love," reminds me to immerse myself in what I cherish, even in these moments. It teaches me the profound happiness and value in being positive and embracing every precious aspect of life!
